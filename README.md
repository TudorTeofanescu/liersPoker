# LiersPoker

A multiplayer card game built with React and Electron, featuring Steam integration.

## About the Game

LiersPoker is a bluffing card game inspired by traditional poker mechanics where players make declarations about poker hands and challenge each other's claims. The game combines strategy, deception, and card game elements for an engaging multiplayer experience.

## Features

- **Cross-platform desktop application** - Built with Electron and React
- **Steam integration** - Friend invites, achievements, and matchmaking
- **Multiple game modes** - Play with friends or join matchmaking
- **Beautiful UI** - Responsive and intuitive interface
- **Multiplayer support** - Play online with friends or strangers

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Desktop Runtime**: Electron
- **Game Server**: Node.js with Socket.IO
- **Steam Integration**: Greenworks SDK

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or newer)
- npm or yarn
- [Steam SDK](https://partner.steamgames.com/) (only for production builds)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lierspoker.git
   cd lierspoker
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development environment:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start both the React development server and the Electron application.

### Development Without Steam

For development without Steam SDK:

```
npm run dev:no-steam
```

This uses a mock implementation of the Steam interface.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```
npm run build
```

This will compile the React application and package it with Electron for your current platform.

## Game Rules

### Basic Gameplay

1. Players are dealt initial cards (2 per player).
2. On their turn, players can make a declaration about poker hands.
3. Other players can challenge declarations they believe are false.
4. Losers of challenges receive additional cards.
5. Players with 6 or more cards are eliminated.
6. Last player remaining wins the game.

### Declarations

A declaration is a claim about a poker hand that might exist among all the cards in play. Declarations must follow standard poker hand rankings and must be higher than the previous declaration.

### Challenges

When a player believes a declaration is false, they can challenge with "Trombon!" If the declared hand doesn't exist among all cards in play, the declarer loses the challenge. If it does exist, the challenger loses.
